# Question

What is an "inline function"? Give an example with your definition.

# Answer

A "inline function" is a function that in as a whole function use for that instance. It's not a reusable function.

Example:

```javascript
const yell = (msg) => `${msg.toUpperCase()}!`;
const greet = (msg, callback) => console.log(yell(msg));
greet("Name", yell);
// ^ That was a callback function
greet("Message", `${msg.toUpperCase(msg)}!`);
// ^ That was an inline function
```
