# Question

What is an "inline function"? Give an example with your definition.

# Answer

A "inline function" is a function that in as a whole function use for that instance. It's not a reusable function.

Example:

```javascript
const yell = (msg) => `${msg.toUpperCase()}!`;
const greet = (msg, callback) => console.log(yell(msg));
greet("Name", yell);
// ^ That was a callback function
greet("Message", `${msg.toUpperCase(msg)}!`);
// ^ That was an inline function
```

# Teacher Feedback

The first sentence is unclear but you are right about it not being reusable! In your example, you forgot the inline function! `.toUpperCase()` is a method, not a higher order method. 

Here is what an example could look like: 

`const screamAtEveryone = (msg, () => {`${msg}.toUpperCase()`});`
