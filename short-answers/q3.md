# Question

What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer

The `()` after the `printDouble` is an extra in the 3 line of the code snippet, it doesn't need to be invoke twice since it already invoked by `.forEach` with an input.
